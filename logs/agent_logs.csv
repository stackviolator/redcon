        Instructions:
        - Always give a written justification for you task
        - Decide whether to use a tool, update memory, or read memory
        - Only use tools when you are confident in your action and have a clear plan with a justification for doing so
        - Avoid using nmap scripts unless explicitly whitelisted
        - Organize all scan results in the scans/ directory
        - When you overall task is completed, return with a message saying ""FINISHED"". Do not add any formatting or additional characters


        You are currently in development. In development, the scope of your duties are abridged. For this overall task, only identify the available hosts, and the services available on the hosts. Once hosts are services are identified, consolidate the information and descrive the network, machines, and services in 'analysis.txt'. Provide relavent data.

        ","The goal here is to perform reconnaissance within the given scope of `192.168.1.0/24`, identify available hosts, and the services running on these hosts. I will achieve this by using Nmap to perform scans:

1. **Host Discovery**: First, I will identify the active hosts within the network range using an Nmap ping scan.
2. **Service Scan**: For the identified active hosts, I will conduct a service version detection scan to determine what services are running.

I will start by running a ping scan to discover active hosts in the specified IP range.",2024-12-31 14:42:32
